\section{Purpose and scope}
\label{sec:purpose-scope}

Russia, as the worlds largest country by land area, has an extensive
raw materials industry.  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the
Russian trucking industry has undergone a dramatic growth, and
government initiatives aim to maintain this growth into the future.
Since many of the industrial installations are located in remote
areas, logistics companies face great difficulties in managing their
truck fleets, particularly as transportation times are often
unpredictable due to weather, accidents and the generally poor
condition of the Russian road network.  As an additional complication,
the distant locations and low population densities prevents the use of
many common communication technologies (eg. no cell phone network).

We propose the creation of a system, the Siberian Tracking System
(STS), for tracking a large fleet of trucks operating in far-flung
regions of Russia, owned by the (fictive) Siberian Trucking Company
(STC).  A central server installation will be informed of the location
and state of every truck in the fleet, permitting decision making
systems to have complete knowledge of the state of the company assets.
Each truck is responsible for tracking its own progress, then
periodically relaying it back to the main servers.  The project does
not involve creation of any new ground stations; trucks will use
standard wireless communication methods whenever in range of
appropriate networks. The transmitters on the trucks will only use one way communication to the server, with data of the trucks current position and the speed of the truck. The transmitters are supposed to be low-cost hardware, so communication from the server to the trucks and additional measuring equipment, for instance of oil and gasoline levels have been deselected. 

The STS is solely concerned with the state of the trucking fleet, and
does not do freight tracking or make any kind of business logic
decisions on its own.  While it provides information allowing such
decisions to be made, it is purely a data collection and dissemination
infrastructure.  In particular, it is a one-way communication system.
Other means must be employed to contact the trucks on the road.  Also,
STS is by itself not concerned with doing data mining or presenting a
sophisticated user interface to its data.  Instead, a data interchange
mechanism will be defined that allows other systems to receive
information from STS.

\section{Audience}
\label{sec:audience}

The intended audience of this document, and the reason for their
inclusion, are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Business logic decision makers of STC, who must determine
    whether the information provided by STS is sufficient.
  \item Truck maintenance department representatives, to determine
    whether the additional equipment needed on trucks is realistic.
  \item The developers who have to implement the suggested architecture and design.
  \item Finally, whoever approves the financing of the project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Status}
\label{sec:status}

The basic requirements of STS have been determined, but the actual
design and implementation is not yet begun.

\section{Architectural design approach}
\label{sec:arch-design-appr}

\instructions{
  Explain the overall architectural approach used to describe and
  develop the content of the document (e.g. explain viewpoints, views
  and perspectives). If necessary explain the architectural views that
  youâ€™re using and why each is used.

\label{cha:syst-stak-requ}
\thispagestyle{fancy}

\section{Stakeholders}
\label{sec:stakeholders}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Acquirers: the Siberian Trucking Company (STC) will be paying for the
    development of the system to aid in business logic. The users of the system
    will be members of the STC's business administration.
  \item Communicators: the technical writers who will create documentation regarding the
    operation of the system, while the business administration of the STC will
    be responsible for the training of the end users of the system.
  \item Developers: the STC has contracted a group from the University of
    Copenhagen to develop the system.
  \item Maintainers: the STC has a team of developers responsible for
    maintaining and evolving the STS system after it is completed.
  \item Production Engineers: the STS system will be deployed onto the Amazon
    EC2 platform, outsourcing the deployment environment to Amazon's
    engineering staff.
  \item Suppliers: servers will be provided by Amazon's EC2 platform, while the
    GPS units are assumed to already be installed on the STC's trucks.
  \item Support Staff: it is assumed that the STC has the appropriate IT staff
    for helping the end users of the STS in accomplishing their appropriate
    business administration tasks.
  \item System Administrators: Amazon provides the appropriate hardware
    administration while the STC has a team of developers responsible for
    updating and maintaining the software environment of the EC2 instances.
  \item Testers: The STC has a team of developers responsible for testing and
    ensuring the STS works effectively.
  \item Users: members of the STC's business administration team who will use
    and analyze data provided by the STS to make informed business decisions.
\end{itemize}

    \hline
    R2 & The system must be able to receive and store 1,000 GPS datapoints per
    second. \\
    \hline
    R3 & The server interface for storing the trucks' location data must have
    an availability of at least 99 percent uptime. \\
    \hline
    R4 & The tracking units present on each of the trucks must have a fallback
    when data cannot be sent in real-time due to bad network coverage. \\

    Overview & If the number of trucks in the fleet increases, or if the business
    administrators need to collect data at a greater interval, the capabilities
    of the system ought to be appropriately scalable.\\
    \hline
    System environment & This process will be handled
    by Amazon's Elastic Load Balancing service in conjunction with Amazon EC2.\\
    \hline
    Environment changes & For example, if 10 small EC2

    workload of 5,000 data points per second.\\
    \hline
    Required system behavior & When a tracking device in
    a truck sends data to the STS server, the data will be placed in a queue.
    Based on the size of the queue, an appropriate number of EC2 instances will
    be started or shut down to process the queue.\\

    Overview & If the cellular network is not available, the transmitter on the

    between the trucks. \\
    \hline
    System environment & This process will be handled
    by the transmitters that are installed on every truck in the STC fleet.\\
    \hline
    Environment changes & For example, if a truck leaves cell network range, it
    will attempt to connect to a nearby truck, which will also be connected to
    other trucks. As long as a single truck in the mesh has cell coverage, all
    of the trucks will be able to transmit their data.\\
    \hline
    Required system behavior & The trucks' transmitters will have a queue for
    sending data to the STS server, and will process this queue using the
    fastest available connection.\\

    \hline
    Overview & If part of the Amazon EC2 cluster fails, the error must not propagate to the entire system.\\
    \hline
    System environment & This robustness must be built into the software running on the EC2 cluster.  Additionally, the truck transmitters must still be able to transmit data. \\
    \hline
    Environment changes & If a node in the cluster loses contact with another node, it must ensure that the overall system still has redundant data, such that further node failures can be handled.  The trucks must be able to connect to another node if the usual recipient for their data fails to respond.  If the system is sufficiently heavily damaged that data integrity is lost, it must still be possible for trucks to transmit data, but any queries in the data should have their result marked as incomplete.  \\
    \hline
    Required system behavior & Heavy data redundancy must be built into the system.  Whenever a truck reports back, it may also receive an updated list of communication endpoints. \\

    Overview & If the transmitter on a truck fails, this failure must be noticed and rectified. \\
    \hline
    System environment & The system must have logic to detect when a truck ``should'' have transmitted information, but has not.  We assume that the fabrication and installation of new transmitters is done externally of our system. \\
    \hline
    Environment changes & If a truck fails to report back, the maintenance department must be notified that a truck has a faulty transmitter, and that it must be replaced. \\
    \hline
    Required system behavior & We receive information from the truck register whenever the truck reaches some central locations.  If the truck itself does not send the same information, its transmitter will be assumed defective, and called in for repair.  As long as every truck is guaranteed to eventually stop at such a destination, any failure will eventually be discovered. \\

\section{Goals}
\label{sec:goals}

\begin{description}
\item[Business driver:] Trucking in Russia is mostly done using old and inefficient
  trucks with bad road conditions.  It is not feasible to replace the
  vehicles or the road system, so in order to remain competetive, the
  STC must optimise its logistics intead.
\item[Project goal:] The STC wishes to optimise its logistics by
  keeping a detailed log of truck movement.  By analysing the
  information the log, more efficient transportation routes may be
  designed.
\item[Project goal:] In order to minimise truck idle time, the STC
  desires real-time information on truck locations, such that
  availability for further use can be easily predicted.
\end{description}

\section{Constraints}
\label{sec:constraints}

\begin{itemize}
\item The company has very little in-house IT capacity, and does not
  wish to expand it much.  In particular, it does not want to maintain
  its own servers.
\item Since the servers must consequently be outsourced, the STS has
  to run in a generic, non-customised environment (such as a standard
  Linux server).
\item The truck transmitters are very restricted, embedded hardware,
  that cannot run large and complicated software.
\item Trucking in Russia is at an unusually high risk of hijacking.
  In order to not leak information about the locations of trucks, all
  communications has to be protected from eavesdropping, and all
  queries in the database must be authorised.
\item As another safety-related concern, it must not be possible for a
  third party to falsify truck information.
\end{itemize}

\section{Architectural principles}

    Principle statement & Redundancy of components \\
    \hline
    Rationale & The STS will be of critical importance in making real-time business decisions, so it is important that it is always available. \\
    \hline
    Implications & \begin{itemize}
      \item System distributed across multiple nodes (for example, using multiple different Amazon EC2 instances across multiple availability zones).
      \item Comprehensive error handling in all levels of the system.
      \item Load balancing to handle node failures.
      \item Redundancy at the data level, for example through replication.

    Principle statement & Encryption of communications \\
    \hline
    Rationale & To prevent outsiders from gaining knowledge about truck locations, all communications across external networks must be encrypted \\
    \hline
    Implications & \begin{itemize}
      \item An encryption scheme must be decided upon.
      \item We don't have to worry about security of the link layers.

    \hline
    Principle statement & Cryptographic signing of truck communications \\
    \hline
    Rationale & To prevent third parties from impersonating truck transmitters, all communications from trucks must be signed using assymetric cryptography. \\
    \hline
    Implications & \begin{itemize}
    \item The cryptographic keys must be managed.
    \item If a key is leaked, there must be a procedure for changing them.

    \hline
    Rationale & REST APIs are easy to interface with existing HTTP protocol stacks. \\
    \hline
    Implications & \begin{itemize}
    \item We need visible HTTP servers.
    \item A protocol for how to represent the data in textual form
      must be decided.

  Principle statement & Mesh networking by trucks \\
  \hline
  Rationale & In order to extend range beyond cell phone networks, short-range mesh networks between truck transmitters is used to indirectly transmit to STS. \\
  \hline
  Implications & \begin{itemize}
  \item A truck can relay information about any number of other trucks.
  \item Every piece of truck communication must be identified by the
    original sender, not the truck that managed to contact the STS.

\begin{itemize}
\item The truck transmitters consist of a GPS unit, that gathers the trucks coordinates, and a sender unit, which will send the coordinates to our servers through a mesh-network. The hardware is a commodity-bought external system, but the software on the sender unit is internal.
\item The truck register is a system in which the Siberian trucking company's trucks are registered.  All the trucks will already be registered in this system, so data is imported from here to STS.  In the scope of our project, the truck register is an external system.  The trucks register sends a message to STS whenever a truck is added to the fleet, removed from the fleet, or reaches one of STC's central depots.

\subsection{Functional scenarios}
\label{sec:functional-scenarios-1}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/functional_scenario}\\
  \mycaption{Truck transmitters send positions to the server end gets a confirmation when the data is received}
\end{center}

\subsection{System-wide processing}
\label{sec:syst-wide-proc}

The transmitters will often be out of reach for some network, therefore it is essential to be able to store and send the gathered data at a later point, when the truck again is within range of a network. When the transmitter sends data, it awaits a confirmation from the server before the data is registered as sent in the truck transmitter. If a transmitter hasn't sent a position in a considerable amount of time, when the truck is expected to be at a depot within transmission range, then a notification is raised in the system, to make a technician aware of a possible problem with the trucks transmitter. 


\section{Information view}
\label{cha:information-view}

\instructions{
The Information view of the system defines the structure of the
systemâ€™s stored and transient information (e.g. databases and message
schemas) and how related aspects such as information ownership, flow,
currency, latency and retention will be addressed.
}

The GPS receiver transmits GPS coordinates along with a timestamp.
This information is transmitted to the data collector, which filters
and aggregates the information, as well as tagging it with a truck ID.
These aggregations are sent to other truck transmitters in range, or
to the STS via the data sender if possible.  When the data has been
successfully transmitted to the STS, it is deleted from the truck
transmitter.

When truck position data is received by the STS, it becomes the
property of the system.  If it is to be saved (that is, if
cryptographic checks affirm its validity and the truck ID is of a
known truck), it will be stored in the data store component.  Data is
never deleted once stored.

When a truck is added or removed via the truck register, the truck ID
is stored or deleted from the truck store.  This data is always
accessible to the data processor and must be up to date.  Data never
flows from the data processor to the truck store.

The user-facing API uses data from the data store and provides an
aggregated view to its callers.  That is, data flows from the data
store to the API, never the other way.  Hence, the API does not allow
modification of data, it is read-only.

The data store is an unstructured NoSQL database (SimpleDB) provided
by the Amazon S3 platform.  The truck store is a relational database
using Amazon RDS.

Every HTTP request to the API is logged by the API provider.  Every
component failure is logged by the redundancy infrastructure
mechanism.

\subsection{Data structure}
\label{sec:data-structure}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Data_structure}\\
  \mycaption{System data structure}
\end{center}


The data store contains an unorganised set of tuples.  Each tuple
consists of a truck ID along with a timestamp and the trucks location
at that time. The truck store contains the truck data the system uses, which is gathered from the truck registry

\subsection{Data flow}
\label{sec:data-flow}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Data_flow}\\
  \mycaption{System data flow}
\end{center}
We import data from the truck registry to the truck store whenever a truck is updated. Transmitted positions are kept in the datastore, and a  client can access both via the API.

\subsection{Data ownership}
\label{sec:data-ownership}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\begin{sideways}\textbf{System}\end{sideways} & \begin{sideways}\textbf{Truck transmitter}\end{sideways} & \begin{sideways}\textbf{Data processor}\end{sideways} & \begin{sideways}\textbf{API}\end{sideways} & \begin{sideways}\textbf{Truck register}\end{sideways} & \begin{sideways}\textbf{Data store}\end{sideways} & \begin{sideways}\textbf{Truck store}\end{sideways} \\\hline

\label{sec:inform-lifecycl}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Information_lifecycle}\\
  \mycaption{State diagram for a truck in the system}
\end{center}

Truck information is gathered from the truck registry, which means that this diagram isn't directly a part of our system, but a part of the external "truck registry". These state transitions will however impact on our system too, as changes to the truck in the truck registry will propagate to the "truck store" 

\subsection{Timeliness and latency}
\label{sec:timeliness-latency}

\instructions{
If information needs to be copied around the system or is updated
regularly, explain how timeliness and latency requirements will be
addressed.
}

\subsection{Archive and retention}
\label{sec:archive-retention}

\instructions{
Explain how will archive and retention requirements will be met by the
system.
}

\section{Concurrency view}
\label{sec:concurrency-view}

\instructions{
The Concurrency view of the system defines the set of runtime system
elements (such as operating system processes) into which the systemâ€™s
functional elements are packaged.

If the concurrency structure is complicated or it isnâ€™t obvious from
the information in the other views, define how functional elements
will be packaged into processes and threads and explain how they
interact safely and reliably using suitable inter-process
communication mechanisms. This can be achieved via a UML model (using
stereotypes), by using a special purpose concurrency modelling
language, or by creating an informal notation for the situation at
hand.
}

Each physical truck runs a single truck transmitter instance, which
contains three tasks: GPS reader, data collector and data sender.

The data and truck stores is distributed across several different
processes in order to provide redundancy and scability.

There is a 1:1 relationship between trucks and data processor tasks.
Each data processor is responsible for processing data from a single
truck.

The data receiver consists of a small (fixed) number of processes that
merely route truck data to the proper data processors.

Each API request results in a logical task responsible for carrying
out the request.

\subsection{Concurrency model}
\label{sec:concurrency-model}

  \mycaption{State model}
\end{center}


\section{Deployment view}
\label{sec:deployment-view}

\instructions{
The Deployment view of the system defines the important
characteristics of the systemâ€™s operational deployment
environment. This view includes the details of the processing nodes
that the system requires for its installation (i.e. its runtime
platform), the software dependencies on each node (such as required
libraries) and details of the underlying network that the system will
require.
}

The STS will utilize Amazon EC2 for its data aggregation and processing, and
the datastore will be implemented using Amazon's SimpleDB nonrelational
database technology. The truck register in the system will utilize the Amazon
RDS service to access its database. To simplify deployment, the STS will
leverage the Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, an automated deployment utility that
leverages Amazon's AWS services to provide an automatically load-balanced and
scalable platform for development. The deployment will occur using a
centralized Git repository hosted by Amazon, and new versions of the software
will be automatically deployed when changes are pushed to this repository.
Amazon's software and hardware infrastructure will ensure the correct
deployment and scalability of the STS, as long as the code does not contain
critical errors or bugs.

The STS will use Ubuntu Server 12.04 images on Amazon EC2, and all server-side
code will be written in Python. The standard CPython Python interpreter will be
used to run the STS, and all HTTP-based communications will be handled using the
Apache webserver. Since the STS will leverage Amazon's SimpleDB and RDS database
platforms, no additional database software will be required on the EC2
instances.

\subsection{Runtime platform model}
\label{sec:runt-platf-model}


\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Runtime_platform_model}\\
  \mycaption{Deployment model}
\end{center}

\instructions{
It is often useful to explicitly map the functional elements onto the
nodes that they will be running on, particularly if the deployment
model is complex or the mappings arenâ€™t obvious.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}[h!]{| p{0.4\textwidth} | p{0.5\textwidth} |}
    \hline
    \rowcolor{gray}
    Functional element & Deployment node(s) \\
    \hline
    \hline
    & \\
    \hline
    & \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

}

\subsection{Software dependencies}
\label{sec:softw-depend}

\instructions{
Define the software that will be required on the various types of node
in the runtime platform model, in order to support the system (such as
operating system , system software or library requirements). Where
versions are known you should state these.

Clearly state any known version dependencies (eg component A requires
at least version X of component B).

This can usually be presented in tabular form.
}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
  \textbf{Dependency} & \textbf{Version} & \textbf{Depends on} \\\hline
  Ubuntu & 12.04 & \\
  Python & 2.7 & \\
  Boto (interface to AWS) & 2.6.0 & Python 2.6 or 2.7 \\
  PyCrypto & 2.6 & Python 2.x or 3.x
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Additionally, various non-runtime systems will be needed for
deployment and development, such as Git and Pip.  The specifics of
these are left at the discretion of the developers.

\subsection{Network model}
\label{sec:network-model}

\instructions{
If network requirements are complex, include a network model that
illustrates the nodes, links and network hardware that the system
requires, making quality of service requirements clear.
}

The physical network model is automatically managed by the Amazon S3
platform.  This implies that we cannot provide any guarantees beyond
the SLA agreement, and further robustness must be implemented at the
software level.

\section{Development view}
\label{sec:development-view}

\instructions{
The Development view of the system defines any constraints on the
software development process that are required by the
architecture. This includes the systemâ€™s module organisation, common
processing that all modules must implement, any required
standardisation of design, coding and testing and the organisation of
the systemâ€™s codeline.

Much of the information in this view is normally presented at a
summary level, with more detail being available in other developer
focused documents such as a development standards document. However
you may still need to record some architecturally significant
decisions at this stage, for example around choice of libraries or
frameworks, or approach and tools for software deployment or
configuration management.
}

\subsection{Module structure}
\label{sec:module-structure}


\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/module_structure}\\
  \mycaption{Module structure diagram}
\end{center}

\subsection{Common design}
\label{sec:common-design}

Logging and error-handling will be tracked using the standard Python logging 
module. The logging module on EC2 will be configured such that error logs from
the STS will be saved to the Amazon SimpleDB service for review. Similarly,
traces in the event of an exception will also be logged to SimpleDB. All 
data encryption within the STS will be handled through the PyCrypto library.

\subsection{Standards for design, code, and test}
\label{sec:stand-design-code}

The STS will be developed using the Python programming language, and each of
the functionalities contained within the system will be separated into separate
Python modules. The code will follow the guidelines set in PEP-8, the coding
style recommended by the Python developer community. Every public API contained
within a module of the STS must contained an appropriate unit test either
embedded within its documentation using the doctest framework, or in a separate
Python file using the unittest module provided with the Python programming
language.

\subsection{Codeline organization}
\label{sec:codel-organ}

Dependencies on third-party modules and libraries will be monitored using PIP,
the Python package manager, and each discrete module in the STS must have a
file named "requirements.txt" with an appropriately formatted list of modules
and the minimum version number required for the proper functioning of the STS
software. Deployment and version control will be managed through Git, and the
deployment to Amazon EC2 will be handled through a centralized Git repository
managed using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk.

TODO: add directory structure for STS

\section{Operational view}
\label{sec:operational-view}

\instructions{
The Operational view defines how the system will be installed into its
production environment, how data and users will be migrated to it and
how it will be configured, managed, monitored, controlled and
supported once this is achieved. The aim of the information in this
view is to show how the operational environment is to be created and
maintained, rather than to define detailed instructions or procedures.
}
\subsection{Installation and migration}
\label{sec:inst-migr}

\instructions{
Define the high-level steps required to install the system and any
specific or unusual requirements for it.

If parallel running of old and new systems is required, explain how
this will be done without disrupting existing systems, and the
transition states required.
}

The installation of the STS will be handled through the Amazon Elastic Beanstalk
platform. To install the STS, a new project must be created using the AWS
control panel. Once Amazon creates a central Git repository for the project, the
STS code will need to be configured with the appropriate authentication details
for the AWS account being used, including the SimpleDB and RDS databases being
used. After the STS code is configured, it can be installed by pushing to the
master branch of the Elastic Beanstalk Git repository. All further deployments
of the STS may be handled through Git.

\subsection{Operational configuration management}
\label{sec:oper-conf-manag}

\instructions{
Define the main groups of operational configuration items and common
sets of values for them (e.g. batch and overnight sets) and explain
how these groups will be managed in the production environment.
}

\subsection{System administration}
\label{sec:syst-admin}

\instructions{
Explain the requirements the system places on the systems
administrators (in both routine and exceptional situations) and the
facilities that the system will provide or rely on in the operational
environment.
}

Amazon will provide all hardware-related systems administration, and EC2 
provides a 99.95 percent uptime guarantee. Although hardware failure alone is
unlikely, programmatic errors are possible, so systems administrators must
maintain at minimum a daily backup of the STS data in the event of accidental
data deletion or corruption. To ensure the optimal functioning of the STS,
systems administrators must also regularly monitor the health of the system by
using automated monitoring tools, such as New Relic.

\subsection{Provision of support}
\label{sec:provision-support}

\instructions{
Define the groups involved in providing support for the system and the
roles and responsibilities of each (including escalation procedures if
relevant).
}

The STC will have a team of IT professionals responsible for providing basic
support for the STS. Any problems related to the general use of the system will
be handled by this IT department. If the problem is found to be an issue with 
the STS itself, the issue will be escalated to the in-house development team of
the STC, which is in charge of maintaining and administering the STS system. If
the problem is then found to be related to the infrastructure of the system, 
the development team will contact Amazon AWS support staff.

\chapter{System qualities}
\label{cha:system-qualities}
\thispagestyle{fancy}

\instructions{
This section explains how the architecture presented
  meets its each of its required system quality properties.

While much of this information will be intrinsic to the views
documented in the previous chapter, it is often useful to bring out
some of it separately. In particular, if a quality property such as
security or performance depends on features documented in several
different views, then you should explain this here. For example,
scalability may depend on optimisations in the data model (documented
in the Information View) along with load balancing components
(documented in the Deployment View).
